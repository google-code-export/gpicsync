[http://blog.mecworks.com/ Marc Christensen] have created RPM packages for many Linux distributions. More [RpmPackages  informations here].

Thanks to Tobias Domhan:

 "
 just add the following two lines to /etc/apt/sources.list(alternatively
 you can use GUI tools like synaptic):

 deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/tdomhan/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main

 deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/tdomhan/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main

 afterward run "sudo  apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gpicsync"

 you might get warnings because the packages can't be authenticated
 in order to do so you have to import the OpenPGP key the repository is
 signed with, which can be found here:

 https://launchpad.net/~tdomhan/+archive/ppa
 
a video how to import the key can be found here:

 after that rerun the above stated command
 "

* GPicSync from Source:*

You can have the latest development version by doing a SVN checkout in a shell:

{{{svn checkout http://gpicsync.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gpicsync}}}

Then read the README file to check for dependencies.
