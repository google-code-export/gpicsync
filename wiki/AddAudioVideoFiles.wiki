=== Goals ===

Automatically associate audio or video files to geolocalized pictures in Google Earth and Google Maps.

This is useful if you record descriptions of your pictures with an audio device or take videos with your camera for example. It gives more "life" to your geolocalized trips.

This is the first implementation of this feature, from GPicSync-0.99, and it will evolve with your inputs in the [http://groups.google.com/group/gpicsync GPicSync Google Group]. Thanks to David Veeneman for [http://groups.google.com/group/gpicsync/browse_thread/thread/a5a5d08bffa33b97 his feature request and feedback].

=== Example ===

A  [http://local.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=http%3A%2F%2Ffrancois.schnell.free.fr%2Fgeo%2Faudio-test%2Fdoc-web.kml&ie=UTF8&ll=48.534056,8.189406&spn=0.011708,0.029182&t=h&z=15&om=1  test example] 

When you see a "Play Audio" link, use the middle button of the mouse to avoid to load the media file in the actual browser window (where the map is).

=== Usage ===

Put audio or video files in your pictures folder: they must have the same base name as the picture you want to link to.

If it's an audio file a "Play audio" will appear (in the picture description in Google Earth and Maps) and "Play video" if it's a video file.
 
Audio extensions the application is looking for now: ".mp3",".wma",".ogg",".wav"
Video extensions the application is looking for now: ".wmv",".mov",".avi"

You can also add an additional description to the picture: just add in the picture folder a text file (.txt with the name of the picture) and you can use HTML tags in it.
